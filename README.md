# ASL Number Recognition Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of recognizing American Sign Language (ASL) signs for numbers 0 through 9. The project utilizes TensorFlow for model development and OpenCV for image processing, with a focus on creating an efficient, accurate model that can run in real-time applications.

## Project Scope
### Initial Focus
The initial phase of this project focuses exclusively on recognizing ASL signs for the numbers 0 to 9. This manageable subset of ASL signs allows for focused development and testing of the model architecture and preprocessing pipelines.

### Future Directions
Future expansions will include the full ASL alphabet and potentially common phrases or expressions, improving the model's utility and accessibility.

## Directory Structure
- `datasets/`: Contains the ASL dataset for numbers 0-9. Further divided into training, validation, and test sets.
- `scripts/`: Includes Python scripts for data preprocessing and model training.
- `models/`: Houses saved models, organized by model type and training date.
- `app/`: Contains code for a web application or real-time prediction script showcasing the model.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.8+, TensorFlow, and OpenCV installed.
3. Navigate to the `scripts/` directory to run preprocessing or training scripts.
